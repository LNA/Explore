Explore
=======
This is a place for me to keep small coding projects.  These projects all contain concepts/gems/patterns
that I would like to get to know better.

* [Grocery List](https://github.com/LNA/Explore/tree/master/grocery_list): A way for me to practice using Nokogiri to parse files.  Cloning the repo, getting into the explore/grocery_list directory and running ruby lib/script_runner.rb will tell your command line what groceries we need to stock up on.

* [Posts Repository](https://github.com/LNA/Explore/tree/master/posts_repository): Test driving a simple repository for storing blog posts was a great way for me to practice the repository pattern.

* [Code Club](https://github.com/LNA/Explore/tree/master/code_club) Code Club is all about reading code.  The goal is to read each file, line by line, and stop when anyone has a question.
